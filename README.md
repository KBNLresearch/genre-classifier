Genre Classifier
================

This Genre Classifier, created in collaboration with KB Researcher-in-residence Frank Harbers, is a first attempt at training a Support Vector Machine to automatically predict the formal genre of Dutch historical newspaper articles. A graphical user interface for using the classifier is available at https://github.com/jlonij/genre-classifier-gui.
